        <h2>Project</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Skillet Restaurant Group is a local business in Seattle and we
                felt like we can make meaningful impact by improving their information management. This project will
                allow us to real-life skills related to business management and use our skills in database management
                and data analytics to improve Skillet's technology.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>We chose our team project because our team members share an interest and skills in databases and data
                analytics. Our project combines these two interest areas because we will be designing a database and
                analytics dashboard. Working with a sponsor offers structure to our project and a challenge
                that we are excited for.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Our project will require detailed data exploration of Skillet's organizational data + user interviews
                with our
                sponsors. These research methods will allow us to design thoughtful visualizations for the analytics
                dashboard to effectively serve the
                information needs of our client.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Conducting this data exploration will require more domain expertise of the restaurant management space,
                this
                is information we can seek from our sponsors in user interviews as well as doing some of our own
                independent
                research. In addition, field research will bring additional insights into the domain of restuarant
                management.</p>
